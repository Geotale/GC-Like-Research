# GC-Like-Research
This is a project with the goal of doing extensive tests for a better understanding of both emulators and hardware.
Some tests may be completely unused by any software, commercial or not!
# Format
Each test is located within some categories, then within its own folder -- A test should include a Makefile, a pre-built .dol and .elf file for the Gamecube specifically, a README.md explaining and/or displaying the test along with the expected results by hardware, and a source folder to hold the source code.
Each test should be very simple and small. Maybe some other day a large collection of tests can be put into one project!!
